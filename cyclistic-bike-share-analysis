They also show a strong preference for electric bikes, likely for greater comfort.\n\nThese patterns suggest that casual riders are not using the service for commuting, but rather for leisure, recreational activities, or possibly tourism.\n.\n\n•\t **Members** users tend to take shorter and more consistent rides, mainly during weekdays, with peak activity in the morning and late afternoon—typically around standard commuting hours. They also favor classic bikes, which are practical and efficient for short, urban trips.\n\nThese patterns suggest that members primarily use the service for daily commuting, routine travel, or practical purposes, rather than leisure.\n\n\n\n## 💡 Strategic Marketing Recommendations\n\nTo convert casual riders into annual members, we recommend:\n\n1. 🎁 **Free trial or discounted first month** to lower entry barrier\n2. 📉 **Show savings** in cost compared to casual usage\n3. 🚴 **Offer exclusive member perks** (e.g. weekend tours, faster support)\n4. 👥 **Referral or duo offers** for friends or couples\n5. 🧾 **Hybrid subscription plans** (e.g. 10 rides/month)\n6. 📣 **Marketing campaigns focused on weekends**, when casuals are most active\n\n---\n\n### 📌 Conclusion\n\nThe behavioral differences between casual riders and members offer a **clear opportunity** for targeted marketing.  \nBy addressing the **motivations and habits** of casual users, Cyclistic can **increase its conversion rate** and grow its base of loyal, commuting customers.\n\n","metadata":{}}]}
